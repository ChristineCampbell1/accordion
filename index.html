            <div class="acc-header">What programs do you offer?</div>
            <div class="acc-body">We offer 3 online programs:
                BA in Digital Technology and Cultures, 
                BA in Organizational Leadership, 
                Certificate in Web Development

            <div class="acc-header">What does it mean to be online?
            </div>
            <div class="acc-body">All of the course work is delivered in online modules. Students usually have 2 sets of deliverables due once a week: an online discussion mid-week, and some other product due Sunday by midnight.

            <!-- third panel -->
            <div class="acc-header">Are online degrees different?
            </div>
            <div class="acc-body">No. At Seattle University, online graduates receive the same diploma as traditional undergraduates do—there is no difference whether you attended online or in-person. Our professors and instructors are SU faculty and bring the same rigor and passion to their teaching of online working professional students as they do to their in-person classes.

            <!-- sixth panel -->
            <div class="acc-header">What pre-requisites do I need?
            </div>
            <div class="acc-body">For the BA programs, the only requirements are: 45 prior credits from an undergraduate institution, and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. If you don’t quite have that, contact us anyway. There are ways to get grades up or to petition for a waiver.
